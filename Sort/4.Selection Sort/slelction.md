The selection sort algorithm sorts the array by repeatedly finding the min element and placing it in the first place of the unsorted array.
Time Complexity:
          Worst case complexity:O(n*n)
          Average case complexity:O(n*n)
          Best case complexity:O(n*n)
It is not a stable sorting method.
