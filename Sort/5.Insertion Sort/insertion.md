Insertion sort is a simple sorting technique.The values from the unsorted array are picked and placed in sorted array.It works like arranging a deck of cards in our hand.
Time Complexity:
          Worst case complexity:O(n*n)
          Average case complexity:O(n*n)
          Best case complexity:O(n)
It is a stable sorting technique.
